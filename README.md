# Tech Gadget Launch Webpage

Welcome to my **Tech Gadget Launch** project! ðŸš€

This is a simple, static webpage I built using basic **HTML** to simulate the launch of a new tech gadget. Itâ€™s designed to provide a clean and informative user experience, showcasing the productâ€™s features, a countdown to the launch date, and a call-to-action for users to get excited.

### Key Features:
- **Product Description**: A brief intro to the new gadget.
- **Key Features Section**: Lists the main features of the product.
- **Countdown Timer**: Visual countdown to the product launch.
- **Call to Action**: A section for users to sign up and get notified.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage content.

### Whatâ€™s Not Included:
- **CSS**: For styling and making the page visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: No interactive features yet (thinking about adding a countdown timer or animations in the future).
- **Backend**: This is a purely front-end project, no databases or server-side features.
